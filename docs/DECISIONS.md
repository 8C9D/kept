# Decisions

Append-only.
One dated entry per decision: what was decided, what was rejected, and why.

## 2026-08-05 - Wave-0 gate decisions (applied at start of wave 1)

**`receipts.deleted_at timestamptz NULL` added for soft delete.**
Rejected: hard delete, and a `deleted` enum status.
Why: §6 specifies a soft-delete endpoint and §10B makes retention (CRA six years) non-deferrable, but the wave-0 schema had no column to express it; a nullable timestamp records when, keeps `status` about the confirm workflow, and non-null rows are excluded from every list, count, and export.

**`receipt_images.user_id uuid NOT NULL` (FK to users) denormalized; unique `(user_id, sha256)` replaces `(receipt_id, sha256)`.**
Rejected: the original per-receipt unique, and enforcing user-scoped uniqueness through a join or application code.
Why: the per-receipt constraint only prevented the same image twice on one receipt, which is nobody's failure mode; a constraint that needs a join is not a constraint.
Scope honesty (recorded in the spec): the hash catches re-uploaded identical files, never a re-scanned paper receipt; near-duplicate detection on date+vendor+total is v2.

**`receipts.status` gains `DEFAULT 'pending'`.**
Rejected: no default (the wave-0 as-written reading).
Why: unlike `is_business`, status is a system state rather than a concealed human choice, and defaulting to `pending` is fail-closed because pending rows never export.

**`updated_at` is maintained by a Postgres trigger.**
Rejected: handler code and ORM hooks (`$onUpdate`).
Why: a field whose freshness depends on every future handler remembering it silently rots.

**`receipts.vendor` becomes nullable.**
Rejected: NOT NULL with a placeholder string.
Why: an illegible vendor is a real outcome; a forced placeholder corrupts the field for everyone reading it later.

## 2026-08-05 - Wave 1

**`users.display_name` becomes nullable.**
Rejected: NOT NULL with an empty-string default at sign-in.
Why: Apple provides the person's name only on first authorization, only client-side, and possibly not at all; an empty-string default is exactly the silently-defaulted-value anti-pattern the quality rules ban.

**`receipt_images` gains `deleted_at`; the `(user_id, sha256)` unique becomes partial (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`); DELETE stamps image rows with the receipt in one transaction.**
Rejected: hard-deleting image rows on receipt delete (breaks retention), and keeping the full unique (delete-then-recapture of the same file would 409 forever against an invisible row).
Why: surfaced by the wave-1 reviewer pass; the partial index keeps rows for CRA retention while freeing the duplicate slot.

**Validation with zod, JWTs with jose; no other new runtime dependencies.**
Rejected: hand-rolled validators (verbose, and a second validation style would inevitably appear) and hand-rolled JWT handling (signature verification is not code to write oneself).
Why: both are the boring standard choices; jose's remote JWK set also handles Apple's key rotation, which the kickoff explicitly required.

**The Apple test bypass is injection-only.**
Rejected: an env var or config flag selecting a fake verifier.
Why: the kickoff demands the bypass be structurally impossible in production; `createApp` takes a verifier as a value, the production entrypoint always constructs the real one, and no configuration value can swap them - tests build their own app with a fake.

**Export routes answer 501 until wave 2.**
Rejected: an in-memory job store now.
Why: §6 specifies job id + polling but §5 defines no job store; that design decision belongs to wave 2 (an `export_jobs` table is the likely answer, since losing job state on restart mid-year-end-export is the wrong failure mode), and an honest 501 keeps the auth surface final without pretending.

**`GET /api/receipts` gained a `status` filter beyond §6's list.**
Rejected: leaving the confirm queue to client-side filtering of full lists.
Why: §6A's "next unconfirmed receipt" queue on both clients needs the server to answer "pending only" directly.

**Object keys are prefixed `{userId}/` and creates reject keys outside the session user's prefix.**
Rejected: accepting any object key (would let a receipt point at, and later presign a download for, another user's stored object).
Why: closes the one path where client-supplied input could cross the isolation boundary.
